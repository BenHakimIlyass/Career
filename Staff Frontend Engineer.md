# Staff Frontend Engineer

## From Ilyass Ben Hakim

Hey Salwa and Mauvi Labs team,

I would like to express my interest in joining your team and being part of the mission.

I have experience as a founding engineer, primarily focused on frontend, for successful startups like MarketLeap (raised recently a new 1.5M euro after the first 1M euro) and MonkAI (recently acquired by ACV Auctions for 19M usd). I've worked with React for 7 years and am open to other frameworks as well.

I believe I can add value to your startup and would love to chat!

(a link to apply for this position is missing, please accept my humble application)
